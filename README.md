## Features

- **React App with Docker**:
  - Dockerfile to build and serve a static React app using Nginx.
  - The Dockerfile installs dependencies, builds the app, and serves it via Nginx.
  
- **Next.js App with Docker**:
  - Dockerfile to build and run a server-side rendered (SSR) Next.js app.
  - The Dockerfile installs dependencies, builds the app, and serves it using the Next.js server (`next start`).

## Prerequisites
